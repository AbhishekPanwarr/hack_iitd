**Betrayal Risk Score (BRS) Calculation and Deployment**

### **Introduction**
In order to predict whether an individual will betray their clan, we compute a Betrayal Risk Score (BRS) based on quantitative and encoded qualitative data. This documentation outlines the entire process involved in calculating a logically appealing BRS, along with all the necessary steps.

---

### **1. Factors Involved in Computing BRS**

#### **1.1 Present Monetary Status**
**Parameters:**
- e: Total wealth owned by an individual, including the value of their assets and liabilities.
- ē: Average wealth of all individuals in the population.

The **Monetary Index (E)** is defined as:  
$$E = \frac{e}{\bar{e}}$$

Where:
- **E > 1**: Individual wealth is above average.
- **E < 1**: Individual wealth is below average.

**Classification of Monetary Status:**
- **E < 0.5**: Below Poverty Line
- **0.5 < E < 3**: Lower Middle Class
- **3 < E < 10**: Upper Middle Class
- **E > 10**: Upper Class

Higher values of **E** indicate a lower likelihood of betrayal due to financial stability.

---

#### **1.2 Greed Level**
The **Greed Level** is estimated using the rate of change of the monetary index, denoted as **dE/dt**. It indicates how fast wealth is changing:
- **dE/dt >> 0**: Rapid wealth accumulation, implying increased betrayal risk.
- **dE/dt ≈ 0**: Stable wealth, implying lower risk.
- **dE/dt << 0**: Rapidly declining wealth, indicating desperation and a high risk of betrayal.

---

#### **1.3 Combined Monetary and Greed Analysis**
By combining **E** and **dE/dt**, the likelihood of betrayal based on monetary reasons is analyzed:
- **E >> 1 and dE/dt >> 0**: High wealth and rapid accumulation—high risk of betrayal.
- **E >> 1 and dE/dt ≈ 0**: High wealth but stable—low risk.
- **E ≈ 1 and dE/dt >> 0**: Moderate risk.
- **dE/dt << 0**: High risk due to declining wealth.

---

#### **1.4 Improved Mathematical Representation**
Monetary Index **E**:  
$$E = \frac{e}{\bar{e}}$$

Rate of Change of Monetary Index **dE/dt**:  
$$\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{1}{\bar{e}} \left( \frac{de}{dt} - \frac{e}{\bar{e}} \frac{d\bar{e}}{dt} \right)$$

Risk of Betrayal **R**:  
$$R(E, \frac{dE}{dt}) = \alpha \frac{dE}{dt} - \beta E$$

Where:
- **α**: Influence of greed.
- **β**: Influence of monetary stability.

---

### **2. Loyalty Factor**
**Loyalty Points (LP)** quantify a soldier's dedication. They are computed using the formula:  
$$LP = e^{(l * C * P)}$$

Where:
- **l**: Loyalty Index.
- **C**: Consistency Multiplier.
- **P**: Peer Validation.

---

### **3. Discontent or Revenge Intent**
**Contentment Index (C)** reflects a soldier's satisfaction level and is calculated as:  
$$C = \frac{D + B + R}{3}$$

Where:
- **D**: Discrimination factor.
- **B**: Bonding with administration.
- **R**: Recognition and benefits.

Higher **C** values mean lower betrayal risk.

---

### **4. Family Background**
**Family Influence Ratio (Y)** captures the impact of family loyalty on betrayal risk:  
$$Y = \frac{e^n}{2^k}$$

Where:
- **n**: Number of military family members.
- **k**: Number of disloyal family members.

---

### **5. Fear/Personal Safety**
The **Safety Influence Ratio (S)** balances combat experience against family responsibilities:  
$$S = \frac{A}{2^D}$$

Where:
- **A**: Battles fought.
- **D**: Number of dependents.

---

### **6. Peer Group Influence**
The peer group has a direct influence on loyalty, captured by the formula:  
$$P = e^{-p}$$

Where **p** represents the number of defected peers.

---

### **7. Machine Learning Approach**
To predict betrayal, we use a machine learning model trained on historical data. The system analyzes factors like greed, loyalty, and peer influence, adjusting weights over time.

---

#### **7.1 Normalization of Values**
All values are normalized between 0 and 1 using **Min-Max Normalization**:  
$$\text{Normalized Value} = \frac{\text{Value} - \text{Min}}{\text{Max} - \text{Min}}$$

- **Monetary Index (E)**:  
$$E_{\text{norm}} = \frac{E - E_{\min}}{E_{\max} - E_{\min}}$$

- **Rate of Change of E (dE/dt)**:  
$$\left(\frac{dE}{dt}\right)_{\text{norm}} = \frac{\frac{dE}{dt} - \left(\frac{dE}{dt}\right)_{\min}}{\left(\frac{dE}{dt}\right)_{\max} - \left(\frac{dE}{dt}\right)_{\min}}$$

- **Risk of Betrayal (R)**:  
$$R_{\text{norm}} = \frac{R - R_{\min}}{R_{\max} - R_{\min}}$$

- **Loyalty Points (LP)**:  
$$LP_{\text{norm}} = \frac{LP - LP_{\min}}{LP_{\max} - LP_{\min}}$$

- **Family Influence Ratio (Y)**:  
$$Y_{\text{norm}} = \frac{Y - Y_{\min}}{Y_{\max} - Y_{\min}}$$

- **Fear/Personal Safety (S)**:  
$$S_{\text{norm}} = \frac{S - S_{\min}}{S_{\max} - S_{\min}}$$

- **Peer Group Influence (P)** is already within the range [0,1].

---

### **8. Betrayal Risk Algorithm (BRA)**
The **Betrayal Risk Score (Rs)** is calculated by summing up the weighted contributions of each factor. These factors include the **Monetary Index (E)**, **Rate of Change of Monetary Index (dE/dt)**, **Loyalty Points (LP)**, **Contentment Index (C)**, **Family Influence Ratio (Y)**, **Safety Influence Ratio (S)**, and **Peer Group Influence (P)**.

The formula for **Betrayal Risk Score (Rs)** is:  
$$R_s = w_1 E_{\text{norm}} + w_2 \left( \frac{dE}{dt} \right)_{\text{norm}} + w_3 LP_{\text{norm}} + w_4 C_{\text{norm}} + w_5 Y_{\text{norm}} + w_6 S_{\text{norm}} + w_7 P_{\text{norm}}$$

Where:
- E: Normalized Monetary Index.
- dE/dt: Normalized rate of change of Monetary Index.
- LP: Normalized Loyalty Points.
- C: Contentment Index (no normalization needed).
- Y: Normalized Family Influence Ratio.
- Y: Normalized Safety Influence Ratio.
- P: Peer Group Influence.

Weights **\(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5, w_6, w_7\)** represent the relative importance of each betrayal factor.

### **9. Adjusting Weights in the Betrayal Risk Assessment Algorithm**

#### **9.1 Initial Weights Calculation**
Initial weights are derived from historical data using logistic regression. The coefficients for factors like **Greed (dE/dt)**, **Loyalty Points (LP)**, and **Peer Influence (P)** are normalized to sum to 1.

---

#### **9.2 Real-Time Adjustments of Weights**
Weights are adjusted dynamically using the formula:  
$$w_{i_{\text{new}}} = w_{i_{\text{old}}} + \eta \cdot (\text{Actual Outcome} - \text{Predicted Outcome}) \cdot X_i$$

Where:
- **W_inew**: Updated weight for factor **i**.
- **W_iold**: Previous weight.
- **Eta**: Learning rate.
- **Actual Outcome**: Real-world outcome (1 for betrayal, 0

 for no betrayal).
- **Predicted Outcome**: Model’s predicted chance of betrayal.
- **X_i**: Score for factor **i**.

---

#### **9.3 Battlefield Condition Adjustments**
Weights can be adjusted under battlefield conditions:  
$$w_{i_{\text{new}}} = w_{i_{\text{old}}} \times \left( 1 + \frac{\text{Condition Factor Importance}}{100} \right)$$

Example: If resource shortages increase the importance of **Safety Influence (S)** by 25%, the new weight becomes:  
$$w_S = w_S \times 1.25$$
